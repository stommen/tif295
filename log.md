## Wednesday 25/9

- **_8.00_** Short introduction

### LAB 1

- **_8.30_** Lab tour/instructions

- **_9.00_** Pipeting exercise and high school chemistry repetition. We decided to make 5 batches of the pH4-mRNA solution and 3 batches of pH7-mRNA (each batch should be enough for 120 μl). The $c_1V_1 = c_2V_2$ formula came in handy. We were a bit too keen on the decimal, Simon said that was not so important.

      - Solution 1 (pH4): 588.25 ul buffer and 61.8 μl mRNA solution
      - Solution 2 (pH7): 362 ul buffer and 38 μl mRNA solution.

- **_9.30_** Started making our LNP-solutions:

  1. pH4 with high stabilizer and mixing process 2
  2. pH4 with low stabilizer and mixing process 2

  The plan is to make 2 more with low stabilizer and mixing process 1 and 3. Maybe also some with the high pH.

### LAB 2

- **_10.15_** Julia took us on a tour through the lab cleaning process. We filtered water so that the LNP can be seen (water is already filtered in a chemical sense but for theses were small particles we need to filter more). Then we cleaned the materials used for the analyzation and put the filtered water in vakuum in order to get rid of air concentrated in the water.

- **_11.20_** Completed our first test measurement and got familiar with the measurement equipment. Also did a first real measurement on 1000x_low_pH4_2nd-mixing and tested to clean the pipes and sample with water and buffer.

- **_12.30_** Lunch

- **_13.40_** Got back, ran a test on the 1000x_high_pH4_2-mixing. The result showed smaller particles in general which was reasonable since more stabilizer equals more surface space.

- **_14.20_** Made some more samples with Simon with SPARK-mixing and manual mixing (1000x_low_pH4_1 and 1000x_low_pH4_3).

- **_15.00_** Ran a test on the 1000x_low_pH_3. Unfortunately there were too many particles so we had to clean the equipment and try again, with the samples more diluted to lower the particle amount.

- **_15.20_** Oscar writing Lablogg and Jonatan minding his diluting business.

- **_15.30_** Ran tests on the more diluted 5000x_low_pH_3. Looked better, still many particles per frame but a really sharp edge in the distribution so the mixing seemed to be accurate, Julia said that Simon will be very pleased.

- **_16.00_** Jonatan started to make more lipid solution while Oscar cleaned the instrumentation and started a test on 1000x_low_pH_1. Plan is then to do a last measurement on a pH7-low-solution.

- **_16.20_** We finished making the lipid solution and then made a new sample as planned, with the pH7-RNA. Then we diluted it 1000x and mixed it with the vortex.

- **_16.30_** Cleaned the pipes of the tracking device and started the test on the 1000x_low_pH7_2. Oscar cleaned the sample preparation area and Jonatan kept the lab supervisors busy.

- **_16.50_** Test finished, cleaned the tracking device, its pipes and the area around it. Downloaded the data to an USB (took a while).

- **_17.30_** Went home.

## Monday 30/9

### Lab 3

- **_8.00_** Introduction and theory about the third lab.

- **_8.30_** Continued with degasing the buffer solutions in the vacuum chamber and cleaning (MQ + ethanol) of the glass sheets/chips.

- **_8.45_** Additional cleaning with ozon cleaner. The ozon reacts with the glass sheet to make it (more) negatively charged and hydrophilic which makes the binding to our samples more effective.

- **_9.00_** Made a small experiment to see the difference of hydrophobicity between a treated glass sheet vs. a non-treated one - huge difference! We will now try to attach the glass sheet to the actual chip where we will then insert our samples.

- **_9.15_** Attachment went well, we then filled the different wells of the chip with 7.4 pH MB and then went on to the microscope. There Simon had a demonstration of the equipment and showed the microscope. Oscar prepared the automatic injection pump and Simon initialized the technical aspects and also the microscope itself. Oil (larger refractive index) was used at the objective to catch a larger spectrum of the view.

- **_9.45_** Performed a vesicle bilayer run through the microscope and saw the expected "desolvation" of the vesicles when they left their spherical shape. Now a layer has formed on the glass chip and we will study how well the LNP's are able to attach to the bilayer at different pH. The hypothesis, since the bilayer is negatively charged, is that the highest number of attachments will be when the sample is diluted in the lower pH solution.

- **_10.00_** Done with the bilayer run, we will now clean the pipes from vesicles with 7.4 pH MB and then we will begin to look at our samples.

- **_10.20_** Oscar writing labblogg and Jonatan preparing diluted (100x) solutions of our spark LNP's together with pH 4 and 7 buffer. Used a total volume of $\approx$ 1.5 ml, where 0.015 ml come from the LNP sample.

- **_10.40_** We did a run with the pH7 spark sample, as expected almost none of the LNP attached to the bilayer surface.

- **_11.00_** Clean/rinse the pipes of pH7 LNP's with pH7 MB. Then we rinsed it again with pH4, equilibrating the system, getting ready to test the pH4 spark sample.

- **_11.10_** Started a test with the pH4 sample, as expected, the LNP's bound to the bilayer. We will try to infuse even more LNP solution to examine if more and more bind or if something else happens. Stopped the pump, so we might see a jump in the attached particles vs. time function.

- **_11.30_** We also made an experiment testing the protein binding of biotin. First we cleaned with pH7 MB while diluting the protein 20x with pH7 MB. Unfortunately, the flow rate was too high (the same as before), so that the proteins had less time to bind to the bilayer.

- **_12.00_** Cleaned the working area and collected the data files through a USB and went home.
